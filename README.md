ModernDeck Mini Client
==================

ModernDeck Mini Client was the version of ModernDeck which relied on streaming instead of storing local assets on your computer. Previously, all non-Opera versions of ModernDeck relied on streaming, up until ModernDeck 7.

**ModernDeck Mini Client is going away. Most browsers should have autoupdated it a while ago, but if it hasn't, it'd be a good idea to make sure it does.**

**ModernDeck 7.0 deprecated ModernDeck Mini Client, but it was still released for it, as was 7.1.**

**ModernDeck 7.2 will drop support for ModernDeck Mini Client altogether.**

**ModernDeck Mini Client users will not be able to use the ModernDeck 7.2 update, and ModernDeck Mini Client will be turned off in the future.**

**Please ensure that you are using the latest version of ModernDeck 7.X, non-Mini Client, to ensure future updates and to prevent ModernDeck from suddenly not working, please make sure you update.**
